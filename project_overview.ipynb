    "# Space\n",
    "Loads and stores meshes and the functional space for running Finite Element Methods (FEM). It includes useful mesh-related functions, such as conversions from local to global vectors and obtaining local tangent bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Agents should use only geometry-central's mesh. MFEM's mesh is reserved for solving PDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent\n",
    "Good and evil agents share functionalities (they belong to the same class). They differ in physical properties (radius and speed) and the `agent_type` attribute (+1 for good cells, -1 for evil cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "Main functionalities:\n",
    "- `move(...)`: Moves the agent along geodesics based on previously stored velocity (speed and direction are separated).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note:** Implement agent boundary conditions here. Reflective boundary conditions are default for planar meshes; remove/comment this code for closed surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `findFacesWithinRadius(double coverage_radius)`: Finds vertices within `coverage_radius` from the agent (`gc_position`), then returns adjacent faces. If no argument is provided, the agent’s radius is used. Results with the agent’s radius are cached to avoid recomputation when the agent does not move.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note:** Euclidean distance is default for planar meshes. For complex geometries, cumulative edge-length may provide better estimates. Note this approximation tends to overestimate covered surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ligand-receptor dynamics implementing realistic BPRW (see [link](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00503)).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note:** The implemented ODE is slightly different:\n",
    "  $$\\begin{cases}\n",
    "  R_m' &= k_r R_m^* - \\int_{G_m} Q_m \\\\\n",
    "  LR_m' &=  \\int_{G_m} Q_m   - k_i LR_m \\\\\n",
    "  {R^{*}_m}' &= k_i LR_m - k_r R^*_m\n",

    "  where $G_m$ is the area covered by the m-th good agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collision-Manager\n",
    "Handles agent-agent interactions.\n",
    "- `checkCollisions(vector<Agent> agents)`: Detects agents in contact by identifying overlapping faces, then computes exact geodesic distances using the Vector Heat Method ([link](https://geometry-central.net/surface/algorithms/vector_heat_method/#logarithmic-map)). Creates a list of interacting agent indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fixCollision(vector<Agent>& agents)`: Implements interactions:\n",
    "  - Same-type interactions (evil-evil or good-good): Elastic collisions.\n",
    "  - Different-type interactions: Evil cells are phagocytosed and removed with probability `REMOVAL_PROBABILITY` (default: 70%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For very large meshes, running the vector heat method on sub-meshes is recommended (see for example [link](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.19751)).\n",

    "# Field\n",
    "The PDE used to implement the chemokines is the following one (as in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00503\">link</a>):\n",
    "$$\\partial_t c(x,t) = D\\Delta c(x,t) - \\lambda c(x,t) + S(x,t) - Q(x,t)$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $S(x,t) = \\sum_kS_0\\mathbb{1}_{E_k(t)}(x)$ where $E_k(t)$ is the area covered by the k-th evil agent at time t (if alive, otherwise we remove it).\n",
    "- $Q(x,t) = \\sum_k\\frac{k_b R_k(t)}{|G_k(t)|}c(x,t)\\mathbb{1}_{G_k(t)}(x)$ where $G_k$ is the area covered by the k-th good agent at time t.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we go to the FEM formulation we get to:\n",
    "$$\\textbf{M}\\frac{d\\vec{c}}{dt}  = -D\\textbf{K}\\vec{c} -\\lambda\\textbf{M}\\vec{c} + \\big( \\int_\\Omega S(x,t) \\phi_j\\big)_{j=1,\\dots} -\\big(\\int_\\Omega Q(x,t) \\phi_j\\big)_{j=1,\\dots}$$\n",
    "now we have to treat the sink and source term differently, in fact the sources do not change much, only if some evil agent gets killed by a good one.\n",
    "On the other hand the good agents move all the time, hence using expensive integrators at every time-step would result in a bottleneck...\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason:\n",
    "- we keep the source term as is, and we simply define: $\\vec{F}:=\\big( \\int_\\Omega S(x,t) \\phi_j\\big)_{j=1,\\dots}$\n",
    "- for the sink term first lets define $\\alpha_k(t) = \\frac{k_b R_k(t)}{|G_k(t)|}$ now expanding the integral we can rewrite it as:\n",
    "  $$\\int_\\Omega Q(x,t) \\phi_j = \\sum_k \\sum_s\\alpha_k  c^s(t)\\int_{G_k}\\phi_s\\phi_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "from this we can see that the integral term is just an entry of the mass matrix. We can exchange summations:\n",
    "$$\\sum_s(\\sum_k \\alpha_k  \\int_{G_k}\\phi_s\\phi_j ) c^s(t) = (\\textbf{A}\\vec{c})_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for an appropriate matrix $\\textbf{A}=\\textbf{A(t)}$ that can be constructed from the mass-matrix $\\textbf{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the FEM formulation, and using Backward-Euler (with coefficient lag for $\\textbf{A}$ and $\\textbf{F}$) we get:\n",
    "$$(\\textbf{M} + \\delta t (D\\textbf{K}  + \\lambda \\textbf{M}))\\vec{c}(t+\\delta t) = \\textbf{M}\\vec{c}(t) + \\delta t\\vec{F}(t) - \\delta t \\textbf{A}(t)\\vec{c}(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which we solve by using conjugate gradient method + preconditioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: alternatively one could also use the half-implicit scheme: $$(\\textbf{M} + \\delta t (D\\textbf{K}  + \\lambda \\textbf{M}) + \\delta t \\textbf{A}(t))\\vec{c}(t+\\delta t) = \\textbf{M}\\vec{c}(t) + \\delta t\\vec{F}(t)$$"
